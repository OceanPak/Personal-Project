Motion-controlled 3D Asteroids game with hologram-like aesthetics / Hologram Illusion Project

### Description
This Hologram Illusion Project is, to my knowledge, the first interactive holographic game ever. The main purpose is to actualize a dream that I had since I was a kid: interacting with holograms, just like in sci-fi movies. Being a playful person at heart, the prospect of bringing this idea to fruition is excited and inspired me to try my hand at game development. 

In this project, I used a webcam to track the user's hand to play a reworked 'Asteroids' game. The objective is for the player to survive as long as possible navigating through waves of obstacles. I used Unity and C# to program the game mechanics, Intel Realsense to create the motion tracking software, and Blender to compile the game models, all of which I learned myself using online tutorials and documentation. For the hardware, I cut up PVC sheets to create a plastic dome, which will be the medium that creates the holographic effect. I also utilized interdisciplinary knowledge ranging from aesthetics and user psychology to create an engaging product. 

I faced many challenges during this project. For one, I could not find a lot of information or guidance online as no one has attempted to create a holographic game before. However, by preserving through the creation process, researching about technical solutions and the psychology of gaming, and conducting many user trials, I overcame these hurdles and developed a game that challenges the visual boundaries of traditional gaming. 

This was part of our graduation requirement for the Middle Years Programme, where we were offered the opportunity to apply our existing skills to create a significant piece of work over the Year 10/11 summer.
